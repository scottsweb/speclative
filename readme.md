## about

Are you fed up of the &lsquo;could be&rsquo;, &lsquo;possiblies&rsquo; and &lsquo;maybes&rsquo; found in todays news? Take back your time and sanity with Speclative &reg; : An Internet speculation filter (delivered via bookmarklet), that determines if an online article is worth reading (or not).

Test it at [speclative.scott.ee](http://speclative.scott.ee).

## installation

Requirements are PHP/MySQL/Apache. You will need to create a new database and import db.sql into it. Once you have done that add your database and domain configuration to includes/class.config.php. It is clearly labelled. The code is configured to run from its current URL (speclative.scott.ee). It appears a handful of times (class.config.php, index.php, speclative.js) throughout the code so a search and replace will do the job.
